                Jim and I spent the evening playing video games and goofing around at Jim’s luxurious house. We ate a lot of pizzas and stuffed our mouths with candy. 
                Eventually the sugar high wore off & we both crashed in the upstairs room. 
                Suddenly, a loud crashing noise inside the house, woke me up. With a pounding heart, I shook Jim and whispered, “Did you hear that?” Jim nodded;
                his eyes opened wide with fear.
                 We cautiously stepped down the dark staircase towards the noise, the only light coming from the occasional flash of lightning and boom of thunder. 
                As I reached the kitchen, my body froze in horror. 
                There was a burly big man standing over Jim’s parents with a baseball bat in his hand.
                His parents were bound and gagged with their hands tied behind their back. 
                Before I could react, the hooded man turned abruptly and struck Jim in the stomach, who slumped to the ground, writhing in pain. 
                I ran towards the end of kitchen counter and saw a knife block; I grabbed the largest knife there.
                 I sprinted towards the man, swaying the knife from left to right. 
                The man leant down to tie Jim. 
                With one swift dash I dug the knife deep into the man's back as he crouched towards me.
                 He let out a huge cry and crawled slowly through the back door. I rushed towards Jim, who was now waking up cautiously. 
                I held out my hand and helped him up, then freed his parents from the intruders’ ropes. I frantically searched around for the phone and dialled the police. I stayed on the line, providing the police with details about the figure and the scene. 
                By the time the officers arrived, the house was eerily quiet. 
                The man was nowhere to be found. 
                Jim and I, along with his parents, were questioned by the police. The officers took notes and promised to investigate further.
                As the night wore on, the adrenaline of the evening gave way to exhaustion. 
                Me and Jim, despite the traumatic events, found a small comfort in each other’s presence as we sat together on the couch, exhausted. 
                We were both shaken in horror but grateful that we had been able to protect each other and our families. The sleepover had turned into a night of courage and survival, forever changing our bond.
                We went back up to Jim’s bedroom to try and catch some well-earned sleep but that’s when we heard.
